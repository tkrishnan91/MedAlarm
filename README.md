# MedAlarm

## Background
Medicine management is a huge part of controlling various medical complications. Many times it comes down to forgetting to take medecine on time or forgetting that the medecine was already taken.
This can be exacerbated by memory complications as a symptom  of the illness itself. The MedAlarm app helps the situation by ensuring the users take the medicine on time through proof of a picture of the medication being taken. 

## How it works
The user sets up various medicine and dosages with the corresponding time at which the medication needs to be taken. An alarm is registered with a user's phone that will require the user to take a picture 
of the medication being taken at the time. This allows the user to have a source of truth of whether the medication was taken and what dosage. 

## Status
Currently the app has the ability to register alarms that trigger a CameraActivity to take pictures of the medication being taken. Also there is flow to add medication being taken and their respective dosage. 
Next steps are to polish the various flows from end to end and allow for image processing to warn users of incorrect dosage at the time of taking picture.
