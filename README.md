# MedAlarm

## Background
Medication management is a major part of improving patient care and healthcare delivery. The more easily medication taking fits into a userâ€™s routine, the higher the likelihood they will stick with it. The MedAlarm app helps users stay organized by ensuring a user takes their correct medications on time through image-based validation.

## How it works
The user inputs the medicine, dosage, and medicine schedule. From there, an alarm is registered reminding the user to take the medicine at the proper time. To dismiss the alarm the user is required to take a picture of the medication. This pictures servers as the source of truth as to whether or not the correct medicine was taken.

## Status
Currently the MedAlarm app has the ability to register alarms that trigger a CameraActivity to take pictures of the medication being taken. There is also flow to add the respective dosage of the medication being taken. Next steps are to polish the various flows from end to end and allow for image processing to warn users of incorrect dosage at the time of taking a picture.
